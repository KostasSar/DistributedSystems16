    <h3>Why should I recycle my car?</h3>
    <p>1. Cash Money <br> The first benefit of auto recycling is exactly what you’re hoping it is—an opportunity to earn some money.<br> By recycling your car with Carecycle you can get rid of your aged, non-functional or retiring car,<br> while putting
        extra cash in your pocket. </p>
    <p>2. It’s Easy <br> When you’re dealing with Carecycle, it’s very easy to get your automobile recycled. You simply log in, <br> and then we arrange a mutually-convenient time to bring it in. Many people are becoming familiar with <br> auto recycling,
        and the added convenience certainly makes it an easy decision for them. </p>
    <p>3. People Are Becoming More Aware of Auto Recycling<br> By recycling your vehicle, you get the opportunity to participate in a valuable global recycling program<br> - in fact; over 12 million vehicles are recycled across North America annually! This
        prevents a significant <br> amount of oil from being processed in the production of new metal. And while those numbers are pretty <br> good—we can always use one more.
    </p>
    <p>4. A Positive Impact On The Environment<br> The fourth and final benefit is the fact that auto recycling has a positive impact on the environment. <br> The auto recycling business prevents a mass abundance of toxic car fluids from seeping into soil
        and groundwater.<br> Instead of auto wrecking yards that crush cars with no regard for the hazardous fluids that spill out from each car,<br> reputable auto recycling yards like Carcone’s ensure that components like gasoline, batteries, and mercury
        are <br> removed from each vehicle.
